# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Exercises & Solutions
This is a repository for the anwsers to the exercises in the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Progams (SICP) book. Exercises are organized by chapter, so exercises 1.\* are found under the ```Chapter-1``` folder. Each exercise has its own folder within the chapter's folder, titled ```Exercise-x.y```. So Exercise 1.1 would have the following path, ```Chapter-1/Exercise-1.1```. Each exercise's folder contains the exercise question in a file called ```question.txt```, and the anwser is either in a file named ```anwser.txt```, or ```anwser.scm``` if the awser was just Scheme code. Each exercise folder may also contain extra text, or code files that are relevant to the question.

## Updates
This repository gets updated whenever I do more exercises in the SICP book, I am currently reading through it at my own pace, so it might take awhile before this repository is complete.

## Notes
All questions / exercises come from the SICP book, which is linked below, and all solutions come from my brain, so they might not all be correct. If you find any incorrect solutions, or have something to say to, or ask me, email me at: ```Ymxpbmprb0BnbWFpbC5jb20=```. It's base64, decode it to get my email. It might take me awile to respond, so please be patient.
