When Alyssa uses her "new-if" procedure to computer square roots, the interpreter spits out, "Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded". This must mean that the version of "sqrt-iter" that uses Alyssa's "new-if" procedure is executing recursively, rather than the alternative, which is iteratively. The cause of recursion is that the "new-if" procedure is treated as a procedure and not a special form, so assuming the interpreter uses normal order evaluation, the iterpreter would try to evaluate (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) until it reached an end, but the "sqrt-iter" procedure doesn't terminate unless the "new-if" procedure is evaluated, which never happens because "sqrt-iter" calls itself and never returns unless "new-if" is evaluated... you get the point. I just realized while writing this anwser that, if the interpreter uses normal order evaluation, that Alyssa's version of "sqrt-iter" would never end. Iteresting...

Note: Code for my version of the "sqrt" procedure can be found in sqrt.scm
