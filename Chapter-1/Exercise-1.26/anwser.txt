First it must be understood why Louis's procedure is θ(n) and not θ(log n). The reason the original expmod is logarithmic is because it halves the exponent and squares the result, and the input for the "square" procedure is only calculated once, not twice. In other words the number of times needed to half the exponent grows at a log₂ rate, thus making the process have logarithmic growth. Since Louis decided to calcuate the next (expmod) twice instead of using the result from 1 (expmod), he effectively undoes the logarithm by doing many redundant calcuations.
