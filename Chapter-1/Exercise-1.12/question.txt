The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

     1
    1 1
   1 2 1 
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

How to use the procedure in anwser.scm:

(pascals-triangle <row-number> <element-in-that-row>)

so putting "(pascals-triangle 4 2)" would roughly translate into the following english: Computer the 2nd element of row four. This would return 3 (see the pascal triangle above for reference). Note if the second argument is greater than the first argument, -1 is retured to indicate improper usage, an example: "(pascals-triangle 4 5)" would return -1"
