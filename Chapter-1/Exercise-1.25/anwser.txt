No Alyssa is not correct, her proposed expmod procedure doesn't work nearly as well as the original expmod procedure. The fermat-method using the new expmod procedure is very very slow, compared to the fermat-method procedure using the original expmod procedure. Why is it slower? The reason the new expmod is slower than the original is because fast-exp ends up dealing with huge numbers, and big numbers take longer to perform mathematical operations on, so overall the process takes a long time. In the original expmod the numbers being dealt with are not very big at all and mathematical operations can be performed in trivial time. The original expmod uses the observation that remainders multiply when numbers are multiplied which allows it to deal with smaller numbers and less memory.
