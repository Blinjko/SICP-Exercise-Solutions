Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure below in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

The procedure:

(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))
(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
        (else (+ (cc amount
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                 (cc (- amount
                        (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
                     kinds-of-coins)))))
(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))

Note: My anwser is in two parts here, the first is an image file called "anwser.png" which details the process generated by the "count-change" procedure listed above. The second is a text file called, "anwser.txt" which holds information on the orders of growth for the "count-change" procedure.
